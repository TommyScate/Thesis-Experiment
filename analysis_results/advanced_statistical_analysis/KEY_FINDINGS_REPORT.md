# üéØ KEY FINDINGS: Advanced Statistical Analysis
## Text-to-Image Prompt Engagement - Robust Statistical Methods

**Analysis Date**: September 2025  
**Dataset**: 29,100 prompts with time-normalized engagement  
**Methods**: 7 advanced statistical techniques using robust, non-parametric approaches

---

## üî¨ **METHODOLOGY VALIDATION**

**Why These Methods Matter:**
- **Medians instead of Means**: Social media data is heavily skewed (skewness > 7.0)
- **Mann-Whitney U Tests**: Non-parametric tests appropriate for power-law distributions
- **Cliff's Delta**: Robust effect size unaffected by outliers
- **Bucket Analysis**: Reveals optimal "sweet spots" better than continuous analysis
- **Partial Correlations**: Controls for confounding variables (prompt length, age)

## üîç **PARTIAL CORRELATIONS: CONTROLLED EFFECTS**

**After controlling for prompt length and post age:**

### **AMPLIFIED EFFECTS** (Stronger after controls):
- **Actions**: Raw = 0.050 ‚Üí Partial = 0.220 (+340% stronger) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Quality**: Raw = 0.057 ‚Üí Partial = 0.156 (+174% stronger) ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Camera**: Raw = 0.035 ‚Üí Partial = 0.150 (+329% stronger) ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Interpretation**: These effects are REAL and independent of prompt complexity

### **REVEALED NEGATIVE EFFECTS** (Hidden by length confounding):
- **Artists**: Raw = -0.035 ‚Üí Partial = -0.388 (-1009% stronger negative)
